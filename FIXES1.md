Your goal is to help me fully transition this program away from Gemini API usage and over to using LM Studioâ€™s OpenAI-compatible API instead. There are a few specific things that need to be addressed as part of this transition. Please read carefully, as your first task is to produce a clear, itemized implementation plan that can be checked off step by step. Then proceed to implement each item, marking it off as you go.

âœ… Requirements and Adjustments
	1.	Disable Authentication for Now (Donâ€™t Remove It)
	â€¢	Any code related to authentication with Google or Gemini should be disabled but not deleted.
	â€¢	This includes OAuth flows, token validation, and credential handling.
	â€¢	It should be easy to reactivate this code later when needed.
	2.	Update Display of Model Info
	â€¢	On the CLI, instead of defaulting to "Gemini 2.5 Pro" and a hardcoded context percentage:
	â€¢	Dynamically query LM Studioâ€™s API (using /v1/models if available) to retrieve:
	â€¢	Model name (e.g., "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF")
	â€¢	Context length (e.g., 4096 tokens)
	â€¢	Display this live information at startup in the UI.
	3.	Rename GEMINI.md to AIFA.md
	â€¢	Rename all instances of GEMINI.md to AIFA.md, including:
	â€¢	Filenames
	â€¢	References in code
	â€¢	Load logic at startup
	â€¢	Ensure the program now looks for AIFA.md on startup.
	4.	Handle Streaming Completion Differences
	â€¢	Analyze and account for differences between Geminiâ€™s streaming behavior and LM Studioâ€™s (OpenAI-compatible) streaming.
	â€¢	Ensure the program:
	â€¢	Correctly detects the end of the stream via finish_reason or stream termination.
	â€¢	Doesnâ€™t cut off completions prematurely.
	â€¢	Works across edge cases like short responses, abrupt ends, or streams with formatting (markdown, newlines, etc.).
	â€¢	Consider adding logging or diagnostic output (even if temporary) to confirm proper stream handling.

ðŸ“‹ First Task: Create a Fix Plan

Before doing any coding, return a numbered fix implementation plan that:
	â€¢	Covers each of the four areas above
	â€¢	Breaks each into logical implementation steps
	â€¢	Can be checked off as work is completed

Use that list to guide the changes. After the plan is accepted, begin implementation one task at a time, clearly indicating when each task is complete.
